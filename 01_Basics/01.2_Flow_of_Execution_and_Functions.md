# Lesson: Flow of Execution and Functions

This lesson introduces functions and how Python executes code within them.

---

## What Are Functions?

Functions are blocks of organised code that, given a set of inputs, return a set of outputs.

Every function in Python has:

- A **header** (begins with `def` and names the function)  
- A **body** (contains the code to run)

Example of a function that takes no arguments:

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello!")
```

---

## Function Syntax

In Python, the body of a function must be indented.
This is different from languages like C or Java, where code blocks are enclosed in curly braces ({}).

```python
def say_hi():
    print("Hi")
```

Nothing in the function body will execute until the function is called:

```python
say_hi()  # Now it runs
```

---

## Return Values

If you do not use a return statement, Python automatically returns None.

If you use a return statement but don’t specify a value, it will also return None.

```python
def do_nothing():
    pass

print(do_nothing())     # Outputs: None
```

---

## Parameters vs Arguments
- Parameters are names listed in the function header – they receive values.
- Arguments are actual values passed into the function when it’s called.

```python
def greet(name):    # 'name' is a parameter
    print("Hello", name)

greet("Tia")        # "Tia" is an argument
```

---

## Task: Triangle Area Function

Write a function called triangle that takes in two parameters b (base) and h (height), and returns the area of a triangle.

Use the formula: area = 0.5 * base * height

```python
def triangle(b, h):
    return 0.5 * b * h
```

---

## Don’t Print in Functions

It is bad practice to use print() inside functions.

Functions are meant to be reused many times. If they always print something, they may flood the screen.

Instead, return a value from the function and print it outside the function.

```python
def get_name():
    return "Alex"

print(get_name())  # Better design
```

---

## Docstrings

A docstring is a string placed as the first line of a function, module, or class. It describes what the code does.

Docstrings:
- Use triple quotes (""")
- Are saved in the __doc__ attribute
- Can be accessed with help()

```python
def triangle(b, h):
    """Calculates the area of a triangle.

    Parameters:
    b (float): base of the triangle
    h (float): height of the triangle

    Returns:
    float: area of the triangle
    """
    return 0.5 * b * h
```

You should write one docstring per function, class, or module.
Regular comments are not stored in __doc__ and do not show in help().

## Tasks

---
### 1. Distance

Write a function to calculate the Euclidean distance between two Cartesian coordinates. The function must take in four parameters to represent the x-y values for each coordinate.

---
###  2. Converters
Write functions to convert a given measurement from centimeters to inches or kilogram to pounds. An inch is approximately 2.54 cm. A pound is approximately 0.45359 kg. 

---
### 3. Foreign Exchange
Write a function to convert US dollars to Australian dollars. The function should have two inputs: the amount in US dollars to be converted and an optional argument to factor in the latest exchange rate. The default exchange rate is $1 (US dollar) to $1.34 (Australian dollars).

---
### 4. Body Mass Index
Write a function to calculate the body-mass index given the weight (in kg) and height (in m). 

---
### 5. Check my number
Write a function to check whether a given number is even. The function returns True if the number is even and False if the number is not. 

Write another function to check whether an integer is divisible by another number. The function returns True if the first parameter is exactly divided by the second parameter and False otherwise. 

---
### 6. Heron's Formula
Write a program using functions to calculate the area of a triangle given the area of its three neighboring squares (google Heron's formula for ref photo).
Test your program when the area of A, B and C are 370, 116 and 74.
