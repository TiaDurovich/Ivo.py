# Lesson: Variables and Data Types

This file introduces some of the foundational concepts in Python:

- Naming rules for variables  
- Data types and type conversion  
- Boolean and comparison operators  
- String formatting  
- Input/output  
- Use of standard library modules  

---

## Variable Naming Rules

You can name variables almost anything, but there are some rules:

- Names cannot start with a number  
- They cannot contain illegal characters like %, spaces, etc.  
- Reserved Python keywords (like `if`, `for`, `def`) cannot be used as variable names  

Breaking any of these rules will result in a `SyntaxError`.

**PEP-8 Naming Conventions:**  
To keep code readable:

- Use descriptive variable names  
- Avoid names that already refer to built-in objects in Python (e.g., `list`, `str`)  

**Examples:**

```python
length_cm = 20          # Good
width_cm = 5            # Good
# str = "hello"         # Bad: 'str' is a built-in type
```

---

## Comparison Operators

These return a boolean (`True` or `False`) and work with any comparable types.

```python
a = 10
b = 5

print(a > b)            # True
print(a <= b)           # False
print(a == 10)          # True
print(a != b)           # True
```

---

## Boolean Operators

Python has three boolean operators:

- `not`  
- `and`  
- `or`  

These are evaluated in this order (unless brackets override it):  
**not → and → or**  
(Think: NAO)

```python
x = True
y = False

print(not x)            # False
print(x and y)          # False
print(x or y)           # True
```

---

## Type Conversion

Python will automatically convert integers to floats when needed:

```python
print(5 + 2.0)          # 7.0
```

You can convert types explicitly using `str()`, `int()`, `float()`:

```python
print(str(42))          # '42'
print(int("123"))       # 123
print(float("3.14"))    # 3.14
```

These will raise errors if the input is not valid:

```python
# int("hello")          # ValueError
# float("abc")          # ValueError
```

---

## Floating Point Rounding Error

Floats are not always precise. Be aware of rounding issues.

```python
print(0.1 + 0.2)        # 0.30000000000000004
```

---

## Math Module

The `math` module contains functions for common mathematical operations.  
To use it, import it and access functions via dot notation:

```python
import math

print(math.sqrt(16))    # 4.0
```

---

## Use `input()`

You can prompt the user to enter values manually like this:

```python
length_cm = float(input("Enter length in cm: "))
width_cm = float(input("Enter width in cm: "))
thickness_cm = float(input("Enter thickness in cm: "))
```

**Note:** `input()` always returns a string, so convert it with `int()` or `float()`.

---

## Tasks

NOTE: This lesson does not focus on functions, thus each task will need to be run in its own file. The answers, however, are all collated in the relative solutions .py file.

---
### 1. Student Details
Write a program that prompts the user for the details on their student identity card - given name, family name and student identification number. 

### Shout
Write a program that reads a line from standard input and prints it in uppercase.

### 3. Running Total
Modify the given program:

```python
total  = 0
print(f'Running total is: {total}', end = '')
```

to present the running total for three integers. These three integers must be provided by the user. 

### 4. Temperature Conversion
Write a program that performs exactly like the following:

```python
What degrees in Fahrenheit would you like to convert to Celsius? #180
That is roughly equivalent to 82 degrees Celsius.

What degrees in Fahrenheit would you like to convert to Celsius? #181
That is roughly equivalent to 83 degrees Celsius.
```

### 5. Weeks and Days Conversion
Write a program that performs exactly like the following, # denotes user input:

```python
$ python day.py
Enter a number of days: #45
That is 6 weeks and 3 days!
```

### 6. Entrance Fee Calculator
The zoo needs an interactive program that helps visitors estimate the total entrance fee given the number of people in their party. Entrance fees to the zoo is $15.00 per adult and $6.00 per child. Children on or younger than the age of 12 years old will be charged children rates. All prices are not inclusive of 6% service tax. The zoo requested that the program produces the breakdown of how the total price is calculated for transparency of charges. Your program must produce the output in the following format:

```python
$ python zoo.py
Total adults: #1
Total children (12 and below): #1
Total price for adults: $15.00
Total price for children: $6.00
Total price inclusive service tax: $22.26
```

### 7. Coins to Wealth
Australian dollars comes in notes and coins. Coins comes in 5, 10, 20 and 50 cent denominations and one and two dollar denominations. Over the years, you have accumulated many Australian coins in your piggy bank. Write a program that tallies the total amount of money in your possession given the number of coins of each denominations that are present in the piggy bank.

The output of the program must be formatted exactly like this:

```python
$ python coins.py
5 cents: #10
10 cents: #5
20 cents: #5
50 cents: #2
1 dollar: #10
2 dollar: #5
Total: $23.00

$ python coins.py
5 cents: #5
10 cents: #0
20 cents: #0
50 cents: #10
1 dollar: #1
2 dollar: #10
Total: $26.25
```
