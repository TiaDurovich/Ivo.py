# Lesson: Conditionals

## `if` Statement

An `if` statement always has the following format:

```python
if <condition>:
    # The code here will only be executed IF <condition> is True!
```
- <condition> should always evaluate to a Boolean value (True or False).
- Indentation matters! Python does not accept code that mixes spaces and tabs. Doing so may raise an IndentationError.

---

## `else` Statement

The else keyword allows us to provide another path when the if condition is not met:

```python
if condition:
    # executes if condition is True
else:
    # executes if condition is False
```

Only one of the two blocks will be executed, depending on the outcome of the condition.

---

## `elif` Statement

The elif (short for “else if”) allows us to check multiple conditions in sequence:

```python
if condition1:
    # executes if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # executes if condition1 is False AND condition2 is True
else:
    # executes if neither condition1 nor condition2 are True
```
- Python checks elif conditions in order, from top to bottom.
- Only the first condition that evaluates to True will execute.

## `not` Operator

The not operator inverts its operand:

```python
x = True
print(not x)  # Output: False
```

It returns the opposite of the operand’s boolean value.

---

## Truthiness in Python

In conditional statements, Python evaluates the “truthiness” of values:

Strings:
- "" (empty string) → False
- All non-empty strings → True

Numbers:
- 0 (integer) and 0.0 (float) → False
- All other numbers → True

## Tasks

### 1. What shape is it?
Write a program to determine whether it is a circle, square, rectangle or triangle given the number of sides and corners.

**Example:**
```python
$ python3 shape.py
How many sides does the shape have? # 3
Triangle

$ python3 shape.py
How many sides does the shape have? # 0
Circle

$ python3 shape.py
How many sides does the shape have? # 4
Are all the sides equal? [Yes/No] #Yes
Square

$ python3 shape.py
How many sides does the shape have? # 4
Are all the sides equal? [Yes/No] #No
Rectangle
```

### 2. Is it raining?

If it is currently raining, you should take the bus.

If it is not currently raining, your method of transport should be determined by the distance:
- 10km → bus
- 2-10km → bike
- <2km → walk

Only ask for distance if it’s not raining.

**Example 1:**
```python
$ python rain.py 
Is it currently raining? #Yes 
You should take the bus.
```

**Example 2:**
```python
$ python rain.py 
Is it currently raining? #No 
How far in km do you need to travel? #4 
You should ride your bike.
```

###  3. Minimum and Maximum

Part 1: Built-in Functions

Prompt users to input three integers and display the smallest and largest using min() and max().

**Example:**

```python
$ python3 minmax.py
Enter 1st integer: #1
Enter 2nd integer: #2
Enter 3rd integer: #3
Min: 1
Max: 3
```

Part 2: My Own minimum() and maximum()

Write custom minimum() and maximum() functions that take two integers and return the smallest/largest respectively.

Use the program from Part 1 to test.

Part 3: minmax()

Create a function minmax(x, y, which) where:
- which = "min" returns the smallest of x and y
- which = "max" returns the largest

Example usage:

```python
a = minmax(100, -2, "min")  # Returns -2
b = minmax(341, 32, "max")  # Returns 341
```

---

### 4. Shout

Write a function shout() that:
- Takes a string
- Returns the string capitalised
- Adds an exclamation mark if one doesn’t already exist

Examples:

```python
shout("hey")                     # "HEY!"
shout("hello!")                 # "HELLO!"
shout("what is your favourite food?")  # "WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE FOOD?!"
```
