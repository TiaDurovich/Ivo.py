## Your Task

1. **Clone the repository** to your local computer:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/repo-name.git
   cd repo-name
    ```
2.	(Optional) Create a new branch to do your work safely:
 
    ```bash
    git checkout -b "ivos-tasks"
    ```

3.	Open each lesson and read through the content.
4.	Complete the tasks in the corresponding tasks/ directory by creating your own .py files.
5.	Check your answers using the solutions/ directory when you’re done.
6.	Use Git to save your work:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Completed conditionals task"
    git push origin ivos-tasks  # If using a separate branch
    ```

7.	Repeat this process for each section!
